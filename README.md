# ColabHelper
A wrapper useful to work with colab or Jupiter notebook in general.

# Features
As of now the class is able to help in the following scenario:
- Easily backup/restore the tensorboard log dir to your google drive
- Get information about the hosting machine (CPU, RAM, HDD, GPU)
- Play a sound notification to alert you when a job is done
- Get a custom notification on pushbullet (in future maybe other services) useful to have some sort of notification also when away from PC

# Usage
## Import module on colab notebook
```python
import os
if not os.path.isdir('./ColabHelper'):
  !git clone https://github.com/Emmunaf/ColabHelper.git
  
from ColabHelper.colabhelper import ColabHelper
```

## Tensorboard easy backup/restore to/from Google Drive
To make a backup you can use the following snippet:
```python
ch = ColabHelper(backup_folder="/content/drive/My Drive/MyProjectFolder/")
# or just use ch = ColabHelper() and the default folder named ColabHelper will be used.

ch.tensorboard_backup()

# or, if you want to specify a different logdir directory:
# ch.tensorboard_backup(tensorboard_logdir="./runs/")
# tensorboard_logdir is the log folder used by the colab istance of tensorboard. 
# Keep in mind that this correspond to --logdir option specified when starting tensorboard.
```
And to restore:
```python
ch = ColabHelper(backup_folder="/content/drive/My Drive/MyProjectFolder/")
# or just use ch = ColabHelper() and the default folder named ColabHelper will be used.

ch.tensorboard_restore()
# or you can use the following if you have choosen a different name
# ch.tensorboard_restore(tensorboard_logdir="./runs/")
```
The logs are saved in a subfolder of *backup_folder* called by default *runs*.
You can change this bahaviour and set a custom subfolder name by calling set_tensorboard_backup_folder_name(newname).
BTW this is not suggested, when you have many files a better idea is to change *backup_folder* for each new project and then mantaining the same internal structure.
## Generate sound notification
```python
ch = ColabHelper()

# Play a beep 3 times (default is 2)
ch.beep(times=3)
```

## Send a push notification by using third party services
```python
ch = ColabHelper()

# Set the parameters by passing service we want to use(pushover in this example) and the parameters needed for authentication  to the set_notification_params() method.
# For pushover we need two values: user_token and app_token.
pushover_params = {"user_token":"<YOUR_USER_TOKEN>", "app_token":"<YOUR_APP_TOKEN>"}
ch.set_notification_params(service="pushover", pushover_params)
# ... run some time intensive job
ch.notify(notification_type="DONE", extra="Experiment XYZ!") # leads to ->  [<DONE>]\n<Extra>
```

## Print information about the runtime
```python
ch = ColabHelper()

# Print system info
ch.get_cpu_info()
ch.get_gpu_info()
ch.get_hdd_usage()
ch.get_ram_usage()
```

## Save (both locally and remotely) a copy of a dataframe and restore it
```python
import pandas

ch = ColabHelper()

# Get some working dataframes
a = pandas.DataFrame({"a":[1,2,3,4]})
ch.backup_dataframe(a, "a_dump")

```
Then, to restore your saved dataframe:
```python
import pandas

ch = ColabHelper()

a_restored = ch.restore_dataframe("a_dump")
```
The dataframes are saved in a subfolder of *backup_folder* called *dataframes*.
